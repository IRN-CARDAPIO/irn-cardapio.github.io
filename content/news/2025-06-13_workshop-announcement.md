We are pleased to announce the coming DREAM course & workshop, as part of the CARDAPIO IRN IRD project.

It will take place on July 16th and 17th 2025 in LEGOS, Toulouse (salle Lyot, OMP).

We will introduce the Dynamical Research Empirical Atmospheric Model (DREAM) and  show you what it can do and how to use it. DREAM is based on a global numerical model of the atmosphere that can easily run on a laptop. It has been used in numerous investigations from academic studies of dynamical processes to practical seasonal predictions of continental rainfall. 
(see [https://dream-gcm.github.io/](https://dream-gcm.github.io/)


Most of the two days will be dedicated to presentation and training in the use of DREAM. Participants in the training sessions are also welcome to attend the half-day of CARDAPIO presentations on the first afternoon. All sessions will also include a zoom link for external participants and the hands-on sessions will be guided by three instructors. 

_Objectives of the training: _

* Run some simple experiments to simulate large scale atmospheric waves on a sphere, including equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves and extratopical Rossby waves. 
* Explore the large scale atmospheric response to imposed tropospheric heating anomalies and SST anomalies.
* Understand the way the general circulation is forced including the contribution of transient systems. 
* Generate basic diagnostics for a number of dynamical and physical atmospheric variables. 
* Hands-on experience with a simple GCM that is able to reproduce the global circulation with modest computing facilities. 
* Learn how to simulate diverse phenomena including the large scale response to climate anomalies and the global distribution of rainfall. 

_Prerequisites:_
* Experience with unix required.
* Fortran, bash scripts and python will be used.
* Basic understanding of atmospheric dynamics and physics. 

_Instructors: _
* Nick Hall - model code and experimental design: dynamical model and simple GCM.
* Stephanie Leroux - installation and execution, dynamical model and diagnostics.
* Hong Hanh Le - dynamical model, diagnostics and visualisation.
